# Stepik.org
my learning process at stepik.org.

I store it here for permanent access. This section contains the code as I wrote it from day one of my Python lessons. At the moment, I understand how terrible this code is, but for historical reasons, I will not change it.
If you see it, please treat it as part of my story.
